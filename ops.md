# Methodology for forming Raid Parties for external projects.

These are notes taken during the first experimental deployment of raid guild members as another raid party to tackle an external project. Please update with any notes as the process unfolds, and enhancements can be made.

Notes:

We ONLY accept crypto. Otherwise, some 3rd party/trust is required and defeats the purpose of the experiment imho.

## Discovery

Discuss project with potential client and take notes.

Assemble notes for distro/discussion to Raid Guild. Maybe could have a form?

## Form Party

Depending on skill sets required and member availability, select minimum team.
