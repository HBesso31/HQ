# Methodology for forming Raid Parties.

## External Projects

These are notes taken during the first experimental deployment of raid guild members as another raid party to tackle an external project. Please update with any notes as the process unfolds, and enhancements can be made.

## Discovery

Discuss project with potential client and take notes. Assemble notes for distro/discussion to Raid Guild. Maybe could have a form?

## Form Party

Depending on skill sets required and member availability, self-organize a minimum team from the [Registry](./Registry.md). This will be the Raid Party for the project.

## Prepare and Submit Proposal to Client for Approval

In [./Templates](Templates), there is a template for formatting a [./Templates/Proposal.md](Proposal).

## **Summon a Multisig for the Raid Party**

- Spin up a Gnosis Safe Multisig at â‡’ [https://gnosis-safe.io/](https://gnosis-safe.io/)

- Invite team members

- Shoot out an [./Templates/Invoice.md](Invoice) to the project

Get cranking!
